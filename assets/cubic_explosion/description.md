Artist Unknown, Early 21st Century
Wood and Pigment on Composite Base

This abstract sculpture explores the interplay between organic material and rigid geometric structure. Numerous wooden cubes, each displaying a unique natural grain, are meticulously assembled into a larger, crystalline form that evokes both mineral formations and digital voxel art. A powerful tension is created between the warmth and individuality of the wood and the cool, mathematical precision of the overall composition.

The intricate wooden lattice is mounted on a heavy, dark plinth, providing a stark and grounding contrast. Continuing a visual theme, the artist has placed a small blue dot at the sculpture's apex and a larger one on its base. This recurring, enigmatic mark connects this abstract piece to the artist's more figurative works, suggesting a unified conceptual language that bridges disparate forms and styles.
